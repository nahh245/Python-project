Python List Methods Demonstration

This project provides a basic Python script showcasing how to use some fundamental list methods: append(), clear(), and copy().

The script is intended for beginners who want to understand how these list methods work in Python through simple examples.

Methods Covered

1. append()

Adds a single element to the end of the list.

Example:

people = ['bush', 'obama', 'trump']
people.append('biden')
print(people)  # Output: ['bush', 'obama', 'trump', 'biden']



2. clear()

Removes all elements from the list.

Example:

people = ['elon', 'jeff', 'mark']
people.clear()
print(people)  # Output: []



3. copy()

Returns a shallow copy of the list.

Example:

people = ['drake', 'c.brown', 'beyonce']
copy_people = people.copy()
print(people)       # Output: ['drake', 'c.brown', 'beyonce']
print(copy_people)  # Output: ['drake', 'c.brown', 'beyonce']


python "code 1.py"

You will see printed outputs demonstrating how each list method works.

Notes

The examples use Python's type hints (list[str]) for better readability and static analysis.
